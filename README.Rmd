LRTester implements the likelihood ratio test for many common distributions. All tests rely on chi square approximation even when exact sampling distributions are known. Tests require a sample size of at least 50.

A simulation that estimates asymptotic type I and type II error rates can be found [here](https://github.com/gmcmacran/TypeOneTypeTwoSim).

# Test mu of a gaussian distribution. 

```{r example}
library(MLTesteR)

# Null is true
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
gaussian_mu_lr_test(x, 0, "two.sided")

# Null is false
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100, 3, 1)
gaussian_mu_lr_test(x, 0, "greater")
```
