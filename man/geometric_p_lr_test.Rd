\title{Test p of a geometric distribution using likelihood ratio test.}
\source{
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test}
}
\usage{
geometric_p_lr_test(num_failures, p = 0.5, alternative = "two.sided")
}
\arguments{
\item{num_failures}{Number of failures.}

\item{p}{Hypothesized probability of success.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less".}
}
\value{
An S3 class containing the test statistic, p value and alternative
hypothesis.
}
\description{
Test p of a geometric distribution using likelihood ratio test.
}
\details{
Simulation shows this test needs the hypothesized p at or above .35 for a
reasonable type I error.
}
\examples{
library(MLTesteR)

# Null is true. Two failures before the 1st success.
geometric_p_lr_test(2, .50, "two.sided")

# Null is false. 15 failures before the 1st success.
geometric_p_lr_test(15, .50, "two.sided")
