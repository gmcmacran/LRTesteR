\title{Test p of a geometric distribution using the likelihood ratio test.}
\source{

}
\usage{
geometric_p_lr_test(
  num_failures,
  p = 0.5,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  warn = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_failures}{Number of failures.}

\item{p}{Hypothesized probability of success.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less".}

\item{warn}{Should a message about type I and type II error be printed.}
}
\value{
An S3 class containing the test statistic, p value and alternative
hypothesis.
}
\description{
Test p of a geometric distribution using the likelihood ratio test.
}
\details{
Simulation shows this test does not achieve the desired type I error rate. It can be conservative or liberal depending on what the true value
of p is. This test also has a high type II error rate. Sometimes near 100\%.

\examples{
library(LRTesteR)

# Null is true. Two failures before the 1st success.
geometric_p_lr_test(2, .50, "two.sided")

# Null is false. 15 failures before the 1st success.
geometric_p_lr_test(15, .50, "two.sided")
